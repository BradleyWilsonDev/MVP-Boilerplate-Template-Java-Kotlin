This repo is to hold a particular Android Studio template. The template allows you to

- Generate MVP boilerplate code (Activity, Presenter, Contract, Layout, Unit test classes) in both Java and Kotlin
- It'll generate the Base classes needed as dependencies (in this case it'll use a BaseView only)
